Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mohammed Sameh Shaheen and I'm a Computer Engineering graduate. 
I have a great passion for building things and hope to further hone my development skills through building many different projects. 
Some of the technologies I acquired through learning and practice include: C++, Python, C#, NodeJS, Laravel, SQL and MongoDB.
I hope to learn many more skills and to be involved in many exciting projects.
